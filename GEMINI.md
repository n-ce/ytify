This is an audio streaming application, the dev branch is used for rehauling the entire application to use client side rendering with solid js with reactive programming but there are many errors due to clash between the old code because it was different way altogether basically hand written HTML with imperative JS handling and uhtml components rendering in an islands fashion.
So we are starting from the top down.
index.html is done
index.tsx is being continuously changed to adapt to needs as we scale the reactive principles and convert the rest of the code.
The developer is seemingly challenged by the reactive principles and get's anxious on loosing direct DOM control.
