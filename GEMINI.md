This is an audio streaming application currently undergoing a major refactor to a client-side rendered, reactive architecture using Solid.js.

The core of the application is a reactive, store-based state management system. A custom, state-driven routing system has been intentionally implemented to meet unique application requirements.

The current remaining before the refactor is complete:
- a working intersection observer with search fluently managing different search filters
- a working queue
- a working list
- all player issues resolved such as 'cannot modify Store directly'
- efficient communication patterns
- fully typed network responses
- updating StreamItem ListItem and other types to be more robust
- reduction of reliance on Type casting
- efficient use of solidjs
- using generics where possible, even existing code
- using css relative color syntax to build themimg scheme instead of script


developer has specific coding preferences and standards:
- **High-Quality Code:** A strong preference for fully-typed, generic, and reusable code over quick fixes or the use of `any`.
- **Functional Programming:** Prefers functional programming paradigms over class-based approaches.
- **Async Handling:** Prefers Promise-based `.then().catch()` syntax over `async/await` with `try...catch` blocks.
- **Methodical Approach:** Analyzes build errors and existing code thoroughly before making changes.
- **Code Optimization:** Keen on identifying opportunities for optimization, code reduction, and file consolidation to avoid redundancy.
